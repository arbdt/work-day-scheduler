# Work Day Schedule WebApp
This website is for a task that involved creating a workday planner. It was to use Bootstrap for styling, and Moment.JS for time-related operations.
The page is designed to be responsive to screen size, and incorporates functionality to save and retrieve scheduled events from local storage.
